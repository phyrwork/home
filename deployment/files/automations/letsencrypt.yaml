    # Run the add-on when the external IP changes to get certbot to update the external
    # access DNS entry, even if we don't need to renew certificates.
    # TODO: This will never work because Namecheap API requires a whitelisted IP. Maybe
    #   need to change DNS provider to one that supports dynamic DNS updates.
