  alias: Open blinds to 80% at 9am on weekdays and 11am on weekends
  description: >
    Open all blinds to 80% at 9am on weekdays and 11am on weekends. Don't open blinds if
    
    - They are already closed more than the wake position (assume they're closed for
      privacy) or if
    
    - Solar output is high, and record which blinds would have been opened for if the sun
      goes down later.
